Welcome
========================================================

Welcome to knobla.com, or the Knoblog, my home on the internet.  I'll be starting a PhD at the University of Chicago in the interdisciplinary Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology (GGSB) home area.  
This site will mostly contain notes on the progress of my research and education, but I hope to also post a few tutorials about programming or whatever.

Jekyll
------
This site is made with Jekyll, which, for a flat-text fetishist, is an ideal blogging platform.  Unfortunately, I've found the documentation a bit lacking, especially as it pertains to hosting in places besides GitHub.  This site is hosted on Digital Ocean, which is a super easy service for spinning up web servers.  Ideally, I'd like to set things up so that I can use what's known as a "git hook" to push updates to the site.  That way, I can edit the posts, visualize them using jekyll's cute little web server, push my edits, and have jekyll rebuild the site.  We'll see.
